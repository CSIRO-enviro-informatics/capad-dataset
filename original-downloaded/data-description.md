## CAPAD 2018 Attributes:

PA_ID: A unique code for the protected area that should persist between versions of CAPAD. In most cases this number will be generated by the DoEE, and is generally based on the RES_NUMBER provided by the data custodian.

PA_PID: A unique code for a parcel or zone within a protected area that should persist between versions of CAPAD. For example, a protected area with two zones share the same PA_ID and are assigned PA_PID values of PA_ID_a and PA_ID_b. If a protected area does not have multiple parts/zones then the PA_PID is by default the same as the PA_ID.

NAME: The official (gazetted) name of a protected area. Gazetted PAs with no name are flagged as "Unnamed" with a reserve number. e.g. Unnamed HA1207.

GOVERNANCE: The CODE for the type of governance which has management and decision making responsibility.

G = Government - Protected areas with decision-making authority, responsibility and accountability in the hands of national, state or local government

P = Private - Private protected areas where land and resource owners hold decision-making authority, responsibility and accountability.

COMMENTS: Extra information jurisdictions elect to supply.

For Tasmania the following abbreviations were supplied in the COMMENTS field:
BHP = Biodiversity Hotspots Program
CLAC = Crown Land Assessment Classification Project
FCF = Forest Conservation Fund
FCF_DAT = Forest Conservation Fund -Direct Approach Tas
FRs = Forest Reserves
MCF = Midlands Conservation Fund
MBHT = Midlands Biodiversity Hotspots Tender
NFVP = Non-Forest Vegetation Program
PAPL = Protected Areas on Private Land
PFRP = Private Forest Reserves Program
R_40s Offsets = Roaring Forties Offset
Rev_Fund= Revolving Fund
TCFA= Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement
TFA = Tasmanian Forest Agreement


ENVIRON: The code denotes the environment type conserved in the protected area as described by the data custodian. A protected area can assigned an ENVIRON value of terrestrial, marine or both.

T = Terrestrial - Generally includes land and or water above high water mark including aquatic ecosystems.
B = Both - Includes land and water both above and below the high water mark.
M = Marine - Generally includes land and or water below high water mark and may include islands and reefs above high water mark.

Terrestrial CAPAD contains 'T' and 'B' protected areas. Marine CAPAD contains 'M' and 'B' protected areas. If a protected area is coded as 'B' by the data provider, DoEE calculates the proportional representation of marine and terrestrial areas within the protected area (all component polygons combined). If less than 70% of protected area is marine then the whole protected area is included in the terrestrial CAPAD dataset. If 70% or more of the protected area is marine then the whole protected area is included in the marine CAPAD dataset.

Prior to CAPAD 2016 all ENVIRON = 'T' or B' records were included in the terrestrial version of CAPAD and only ENVIRON = 'M' records were included in Marine CAPAD. The method described above for managing ENVIRON = 'B' areas was introduced in CAPAD 2016 (and revised slightly in CAPAD 2018).

OVERLAP: Derived by DoEE. Included, in terrestrial CAPAD only, to deal with the 'stacked' nature of some terrestrial protected areas so that overlaps can be 'flattened' for the purposes of calculating the protected area coverage of Australia.

Terrestrial protected areas with NO overlaps will be allocated a value of "1". As a general rule, where two protected areas overlap, the area with the higher ranking (based on 'IUCN' category and 'TYPE') will be allocated a value of "1" for the overlap field with the lower ranking area allocated a value of "2". For example, where a National Park (IUCN II) overlaps with a Nature Refuge (IUCN VI) the National Park will be allocated the value of "1" and the Nature Refuge will be allocated the value of "2".

For consistency with national scale products like IBRA and IMCRA (and area calculations for PA's across state borders) DoEE applies a 'clip' to the state borders component of the Geoscience Australia COAST 100K dataset � and not the coastline. Each jurisdiction use their own, generally higher resolution, coastline dataset.

Marine CAPAD does not contain the OVERLAP field. To calculate the total area any features that overlap are dissolved using the field of interest, for example: for IUCN calculations the IUCN field only is dissolved, for TYPE the TYPE field only is dissolved. One area which has a significant overlap is Queensland. The Great Barrier Reef Coast Marine Park (QLD) significantly overlaps with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Commonwealth).

For the purpose of area calculations please be aware of the OVERLAP attribute. Users may wish to use the following SQL statement: Select * from CAPAD2018 where OVERLAP = '1' AND NRS_PA IN ('Y', 'I').


MGT_PLAN: The code of the status of the management plan for the protected area.
P - In Preparation - Some form of management document was being prepared.
D - Draft - A draft management document was released for comment by the public, management board or equivalent.
S - Statutory - Enabling legislation establishes the management of a protected area and separate management document is not required.
I - Management Intent - A formal statement of management intent has been prepared that clearly sets out the management objectives for the protected area but includes little else.
M - Management Plan - A formally adopted management plan that has been through consultation and contains strategies and actions for implementation for this protected area.
R - Regional Plan - A formally adopted management plan has been through consultation and contains general strategies and actions for implementation over a group of protected areas.
N - Unknown - No form of management document could be found.
UR - Under Review - The management plan is under review

RES_NUMBER: The reserve number (if declared) as used by the controlling authority. IPA Reserve numbers are allocated by DoEE.

EPBC: This identifies if the reserve can be considered under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).
Commonwealth = Commonwealth reserve (either a Commonwealth National Park, Commonwealth Botanic Garden or Antarctic protected/managed reserve) � as outlined in Section 342 of the Act.
Private = Privately managed reserve
State = State managed reserve � as supplied by State/Territory authority

LONGITUDE: Longitude coordinate of polygon centroid in decimal degrees, derived by DoEE from Geographics projected dataset.

LATITUDE: Latitude coordinate of polygon centroid in decimal degrees, derived by DoEE from Geographics projected dataset.
